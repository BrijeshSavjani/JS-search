<h1>JS-search</h1>
A JS based system to search JS Objects for a website that I'm developing. To use simpily fill in the search bar and press search. Please feel free to use this in your projects.

<h2>How to customise</h2>

<h3>Modifying how it is ouputted</h3>

The items that have matched the users search criteria are held in a public JS list called accepted_items in the Search.JS file. The OutputResults() function is used to programatically output the results into a table. Modify this function to modify the format of the table. This is then styled in CSS using the results_table CSS class. The current CSS code can be find in style tags in the index.html file.

<h3>Modifying Attributes & attribute names <i>(+Adding Attributes)</i></h3>
All of the objects that will be searched are stored in the information.js file. They are in an list called data.
<h4>Modifiying attribute values & attribute names</h4>
Please not that these instructions are **only** for modifying the name/value for an attribute. If you would like to add a new attriubute then please read the next section. The value and or name can be changed with a simple swap. The code will run the exact the same except the output will have the new heading name and/or value.
</br>
<h4>Adding a new attribute</h4>
This is slightly more complicated to do however it is still relatively simple.
<ol>
  <li>The first step is to add the new attrinute the items in the data array that you will find in the information.js file. Please note that all the files need to have the same     attributes or the code will not work.</li>
  </br>
  <li>The second step is to create a HTML element from which the user can enter their desired attribute value.To do this simpily go into the index.html file and an input to the       SearchBar div. Give this input a sensible id. We will need to fetch the value of this from the JS file later.</li>
  </br>
  <li>Next navigate to the wanted_attribute list that can be found in the Compare(object) function in the Search.JS file. Add document.getElementById("[your id name here]"). It   is important that the fetched attributes from the user apear in the same order in the array as they do in the object. I.E) If you add an attribute to the end of the objects     then the document.getElementById("[your id name here]") must be at the end of the wanted_attributes array.
  </li>
  </br>
  <li>Finally you just need to update "if(attributes_matched == 3){accepted_items.push(object);}" in the Comapre(object) function to if(attributes_matched == [amount of attributes]){accepted_items.push(object);}
  </ol>
<h3> Adding custom filters</h3>
Adding custom filters to the search engine is really easy. Simpily navigate to the Search.JS file then go into the Compare() function. Then modify this for loop to yor hearts content:
```javascript
for (var attribute in object)
 {
  if(wanted_attribute[i] == "All"){wanted_attribute[i] = ""}; 
  var value = object[attribute].toString(); 
  var matches = value.includes(wanted_attribute[i].toString(),0);
  //Use custom code to change the value matches here.If matches == true then it will match filter
  if (matches){attributes_matched += 1;} 
  i+= 1;
 }
```
