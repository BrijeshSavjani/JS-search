<h1>JS-search</h1>
A JS based system to search JS Objects for a website that I'm developing. To use simpily fill in the search bar and press search. Please feel free to use this in your projects.

<h2>How to customise</h2>

<h3>Modifying how it is ouputted</h3>

The items that have matched the users search criteria are held in a public JS list called accepted_items in the Search.JS file. The OutputResults() function is used to programatically output the results into a table. Modify this function to modify the format of the table. This is then styled in CSS using the results_table CSS class. The current CSS code can be find in style tags in the index.html file.
